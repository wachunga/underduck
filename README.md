Search for Vancouver playgrounds by feature

## Motivation

There are over 100 playgrounds in Vancouver, many of which have unique elements. My kids gravitate
toward certain features, like tire swings, but there's no easy way to figure out which playgrounds have them.

## Current status

Data collection and "research" will likely resume in Spring 2017. When it's a little warmer out.

I have confirmed that the City of Vancouver doesn't currently have this data as of November 2016 via opendata@vancouver.ca:

> We donâ€™t have any system that collects/maintains your requested information.
